				<h3>Preparation</h3>
				<p>Wash the flowers and pat dry.<br/>
				Fill the bowl half full with water using a pitcher to pour.<br/>
				Place the flowers across the top of the water so that it's completely covered.<br/> 
				Place a smaller bowl over the flowers in the bowl and gently let it drop to the base of the larger bowl.<br/>
				The water should shift up the side gap, which will be about &frac12; to 1 inch (1 to 2.5cm) in thickness.<br/>
				The flowers will be caught both underneath and along the sides of the bowl as well;<br/>
				add more flowers to the gap, pushing them in with the wooden skewer.<br/>
				It can be as packed with flowers as you like, or left more sparse.<br/><br/>
				Put freezer tape across the bowls to hold them in place.<br/>
				Put the bowl arrangement into the freezer for 30 minutes.<br/><br/>
				Remove from the freezer and add more flowers inside the gap, if needed.<br/>
				Or, simply reposition the flowers if they've slipped in directions that aren't so aesthetically pleasing.<br/>
				If adding more flowers to already frozen edges, wet them a little for added stickiness.<br/><br/>
				Place back in the freezer.<br/>
				It's recommended that you check a few more times to reposition flowers or rounds as needed.<br/>
				Then, leave to freeze overnight.<br/><br/>
				Remove from the freezer the next day.<br/>
				Take off the tape and leave on a towel for a few minutes.<br/>
				It might come loose on its own.<br/>
				If not, fill the smaller bowl with lukewarm water and gently ease it out.<br/>
				Remove the outer bowl.<br/>
				If it hasn't already loosened while sitting on the towels, dip it into a basin with a little lukewarm water.<br/>
				Twist the ice bowl to loosen it and gently pull it out.<br/>
				Place the ice bowl onto its own platter or stand.<br/>
				Return to the freezer until needed.<br/>
				If you're keeping it in the freezer, wrap it in kitchen foil first to prevent sticking to the freezer or other frozen items.<br/>
				Serve. There are several things you can do with the ice bowl, such as:</p>
				<ul class="listInsideRecipe">
					<li>&#10048;Arrange a fruit salad or single fruit such as hulled strawberries.</li>
					<li>&#10048;Fill with a garden salad full of edible flowers.</li>
					<li>&#10048;Add ice cubes and stick ice confectionery on sticks into the ice cubes.</li>
					<li>&#10048;Add ice cubes and a few small cans of drinks.</li>
					<li>&#10048;Use a container for dips.</li>
					<li>&#10048;Arrange cooked seafood, such as prawns, shrimps, etc. that need to be kept cool.</li>
					<li>&#10048;Use for a cold soup such as a gazpacho.</li>
					<li>&#10048;And saving the best till last–– fill with ice cream!</li>
				</ul>
